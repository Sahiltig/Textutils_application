Lec 1 - Why react? - SPA - gmail and youtube.
      - What is react? - Its a JS UI library based on components. In a single page, there are lot of components, for instance youtube has lot of things, sidebar, top bar videos, etc.[Watch](<Screenshot (123).png>).
      - Install react developer tools extension in google chrome.
      - Install these extensions. Auto rename tag, ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets, Live    server, Thunder client.


Lec 2 - Create a react app - npx create-react-app Appname
      - Understand the folder structure - 1)index.html is the main spa that we see. It has an element called root.
                                    2) This root is linked with index.js by using Reactdom function. And index.js is linked with a component which is a parent component App.js. 
                                    (It's possible to have multiple React apps coexisting within a single web page. We can modify functions in index.js and call it to index.html.)
                                    3) import and export.

Lec 4 - JSX - Looks like html as its written under tags. But its not HTML. Whatever is there under return is  caled as jsx.
      - Why JSX?
      - JSX rules - 1) Only one parent fragment <></>. Use Div or React Fragment to wrap all your JSX Code
                    2) Use classsName instead of class. 
                    3) Use camelCase for attributes.
                    4) It always returns single element
                    5) Need to close all non closing Tags in JSX.


Lec 5 - Virtual DOM concept?
      - We generally do not give the node modules folder while sharing the project. We delete it. It can be re-installed by doing npm i.
